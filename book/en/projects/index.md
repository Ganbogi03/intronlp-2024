# Team Project

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a team-based, hands-on learning experience focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and advanced language model technologies. Teams of 3-4 students will cover a wide range of topics, from basic text processing to advanced language model API utilization and NLP application development.

## 2. Project Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts and key technologies of NLP and language models
- Practice core NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, word embeddings, and transformer architecture
- Learn methods to perform various NLP tasks using Large Language Model (LLM) APIs
- Master prompt engineering techniques and apply them to solve real-world problems
- Develop skills to design and implement NLP-based web applications
- Enhance team collaboration and project management abilities

## 3. Team Composition and Roles

Each team consists of 3-4 students, with the following roles:

1. **Project Manager**: Overall project schedule management and team coordination
2. **Backend Developer**: NLP model implementation and API development
3. **Frontend Developer**: User interface design and implementation
4. **Data Scientist**: Data preprocessing and analysis, model evaluation

Team members collaborate across different areas in addition to their primary roles, and can swap roles during the project to gain diverse experiences.

## 4. Project Progression

### 4.1 Weekly Learning and Team Meetings

- Individual learning through weekly provided lecture materials and practical assignments
- Regular team meetings at least once a week
- Participation in real-time Q&A sessions (once a week)

### 4.2 Project Phases

1. Planning Phase (Weeks 1-3): Project topic selection and planning
2. Development Phase (Weeks 4-12): NLP model development and application implementation
3. Testing and Improvement Phase (Weeks 13-14): Usability testing and performance enhancement
4. Final Presentation Preparation (Week 15)

## 5. Final Outputs

The project's final output consists of three components:

1. **Source Code**:

   - Published in a GitHub repository
   - Clear documentation and comments required
   - Includes an executable demo version

2. **App Service**:

   - Web-based NLP application
   - User-friendly interface
   - Actual implementation of key features

3. **Final Report (Research Paper Format)**:
   - Includes abstract, introduction, related work, methodology, experimental results, and conclusion
   - 10-15 pages in length
   - Adheres to IEEE or ACL paper format

## 6. Evaluation Method

- Team assignments and presentations: 30%
- Midterm project presentation (Week 8): 20%
- Final project deliverables:
  - Source code and app service: 25%
  - Final report: 15%
- Peer evaluation: 10%

## 7. Key Dates

- Week 1: Orientation and team formation
- Week 3: Project proposal submission
- Week 8: Midterm project presentation
- Week 15: Final project presentation and deliverable submission

## 8. Required Tools and Environment

- Personal laptop (mandatory)
- Python 3.7 or higher installed
- Key libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch, Transformers
- Development environment: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Version control: Git/GitHub
- Collaboration tools: Slack, Trello, etc.

## 9. Important Notes

- All team activities should be distributed fairly and evenly.
- If there are conflicts or issues within the team, please report quickly to the teaching assistant or professor.
- If referencing ideas or code from other teams, always cite the source.
- Maintain regular team meeting records and periodically share project progress.

We hope you have an enjoyable and productive team project experience!
